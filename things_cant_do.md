# Things you can't do in py++ (only the C++ won't work)
- overwrite built-in Python keywords
- use variables out of their scope
- let things have references to variables that have gone out of scope and deleted (this is like the hard one)
- define a variable without a Python type hint
- use variables differently from their type hints
- Name things with these names:
  - PyStr
  - etc.
- Use those class override method things
- Name a file in the root of the src dir:
  - py_str.py
  - pypp_util
- print something other than a string (for now)
- You cannot do integer math and expect a float returned
