# Things you can't do in py++ (only the C++ won't work)
#### Note: some things in here could be old, or could be removed from the list in the future. The list is also a WIP.
- overwrite built-in Python keywords
- use variables out of their scope
- let things have references to variables that have gone out of scope and deleted (this is like the hard one)
- define a variable without a Python type hint
- use variables differently from their type hints
- Name things with these names:
  - PyStr
  - etc.
- Use those class override method things
- Name a file in the root of the src dir:
  - py_str.py
  - pypp_util
- print something other than a string (for now)
- print with multiple args (i.e. print(a, b))
- You cannot do integer math and expect a float returned
- del my_list[i] (use my_list.pop(i) instead)
- Use multiline string literals as comments
- In Python you can assume a dict maintains insertion order, but in a the C++ build you can't
- dict.get() method does not have the second 'default value' argument
- Use the Python None. Instead you use PyppOpt (optional)
- Print an optional
- Make large tuples (use a list for large collections instead)
- Redefine variables
- Call methods or functions C++ reserved keywords (i.e. union, etc.)
  - Or maybe these can just be changed to 'keyword_' in the C++?
- <, <=, >=, > comparisons on sets.
- set values in a list via list slicing
- for loop else statements and type comments (what are for loop type comments?)
- name something 'pypp_hardcoded_it_tup'
- Iterate over a tuple (in pypp, tuples are just used as short data containers; lists, sets, or np arrays can be used 
for longer collections.)
