# Things you can't do in py++ (only the C++ won't work)
- overwrite built-in Python keywords
- use variables out of their scope
- let things have references to variables that have gone out of scope and deleted (this is like the hard one)
- define a variable without a Python type hint
- use variables differently from their type hints
